# WinTango-Patcher for Windows 7 / 8.1 / 10 / 11 (x86/x64)

Bringing the look and feel of a Tango!-Styled Linux to Windows

### About

The WinTango Patcher is a mostly self-explanatory graphical wizard designed to make simple the process of **modifying your system files** with resources which were created by the [Tango Desktop Project](http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Desktop_Projectheme_tango-sel.ico), the [GNOME Project](http://www.gnome.org/), the [Gnome-Colors Project](http://code.google.com/p/gnome-colors/), the [Elementary Project](http://elementaryos.org/) and many other open-source projects.

The included **reloader module** will always re-modify your files if they are overwritten, allowing system updates to be performed without breaking the theme.

### Styles

Modifying your system files and applying the matching Themes will change the default look of Windows and several 3rd Party Applications into one of these:

### Compatibility

WinTango Patcher v24 was successfully tested on Windows 10 22H2 and Windows 11 21H2. It should also work well on other builds of these OS.
WinTango Patcher also works on Windows 8.1 and Windows 7.

### Download

Please refer to releases page https://github.com/alexsupra/WinTango-Patcher/releases to download the latest builds of installer and sources.

### Sources

The patcher release v24 was based on v16 but not v17 which sources are located in the root of repository. The reason is that v17 seems to be broken and reason is still unknown. Thus the working sources are located inside 7z-archives on releases page.
