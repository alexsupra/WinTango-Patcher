# WinTango-Patcher for Windows 7 / 8.1 / 10 (x86/x64)

Bringing the look and feel of a Tango!-Styled Linux to Windows

### About

The WinTango Patcher is a mostly self-explanatory graphical wizard designed to make simple the process of **modifying your system files** with resources which were created by the [Tango Desktop Project](http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Desktop_Projectheme_tango-sel.ico), the [GNOME Project](http://www.gnome.org/), the [Gnome-Colors Project](http://code.google.com/p/gnome-colors/), the [Elementary Project](http://elementaryos.org/) and many other open-source projects.

The included **reloader module** will always re-modify your files if they are overwritten, allowing system updates to be performed without breaking the theme.

### Styles
